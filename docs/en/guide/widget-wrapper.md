### WidgetWrapper

-   It is used to solve flutter's ui system, some Widgets that need to implement the featured interface, such as KeepAlive, because the Widget generated by Component will be wrapped by a Stateful Widget inside the fish redux framework.
-   Sample Code

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

Widget repaintBoundaryWrapper(Widget widget) {
  return RepaintBoundary(child: widget);
}
```
