Fish Redux is an assembled flutter application framework based on Redux state management, it is especially suitable for building medium to large complex applications.

It features a profiled assembly. On the one hand, we disassemble a large page into separate Component|Adapters. The upper layer is responsible for assembly, and the lower layer is responsible for implementation. On the other hand, the Component|Adapter is split into separate context-independent functions such as View, Reducer, and Effect.

So it will be very clean, easy to maintain, and easy to collaborate.

Fish Redux is inspired by the excellent frameworks such as Redux, Elm, Dva.

Standing on the shoulders of giants, Fish Redux will do it further on the characteristics of concentration, division, reuse and isolation.
